# NYC-Blog

Semantic HTML introduces meaning to a page through specific elements that provide context as to what is in between the tags.
<br>Semantic HTML is a modern standard and makes a website accessible for people who use screen readers to translate the webpage and improves your websiteâ€™s SEO

Here , I have made simple blog page of New York City implementing the use of the following Semantic HTML elements :

<ol>
  <li>header</li>
  <li>nav</li>
  <li>main</li>
  <li>footer</li>
  <li>section</li>
  <li>article</li>
  <li>aside</li>
  <li>figure</li>
  <li>figcaption</li>
  <li>video</li>
  <li>embed</li>
  <li>audio</li>
</ol>
